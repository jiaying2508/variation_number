# Variation Number
Characteristic Attribute Organization System (CAOS) discovers rules associated with a given phylogenetic tree. A pure (Pu) rule or character attribute (CA) is a state that exists in all elements of a clade but not the alternate clade; a private (Pr) CA is present in some members of a clade but absent in the alternate clade. A variation number (VN) is defined as the number of occurrences of a position as a CA in all the tree clades.

The method is described in the publication:
